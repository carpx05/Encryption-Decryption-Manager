# Encryption and Decryption Manager

This repository contains a Python script for an Encryption and Decryption Manager that supports both the Affine Cipher and Vigenere Cipher encryption algorithms. The manager provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using these cryptographic methods.

# Features

User-friendly graphical interface for encryption and decryption operations.
Support for both Affine Cipher and Vigenere Cipher algorithms.
Choose between encryption and decryption modes.
Choose between plaintext and cipher text input.

# Getting Started

To use the Encryption and Decryption Manager, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-decryption-manager.git
    cd encryption-decryption-manager

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

    pip install easygui

Run the script:

    python encryption_decryption_manager.py

The graphical interface will launch, allowing you to select the encryption/decryption mode, the cryptographic algorithm, and input text/key.

# Usage

Launch the script using the instructions provided in the "Getting Started" section.

The main menu will be displayed. Choose between encryption and decryption modes.

Select the cryptographic algorithm you want to use: Affine Cipher or Vigenere Cipher.

Choose whether you want to input plaintext or cipher text.

Enter the required input text and key as prompted.

The script will display the original and encrypted/decrypted messages.
